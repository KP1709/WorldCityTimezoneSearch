## ‚å®Ô∏è Tech stack
React / Typescript / CSS / pnpm / Luxon / React Leaflet / Supabase

## üçº Introduction
After completing a technical debt story where there were inconsistencies with time formats in my company's web application, I was interested in looking further into basic handling of dates and times. This tool enables users to search for a city in the world and see the date and time information for it. This includes where it is located and places a marker on the map as well. It was also a great opportunity to explore React Leaflet, Luxon and Supabase. Supabase does the heavy lifting when searching for world cities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Search for world cities through querying the Supabase database
- Displays city location on map
    - Map is interactive with zoom control for phone and desktop
    - Marker is placed where city is
- Responsive design - for both phone and desktop
- Display current time (which updates every minute)
    - Shows date, timezone, timezone id and location
- Displays main flag for the country the city is in
    - Shows second flag if a region or state does have one
- Light/Dark mode overlay on map
    - Requires reloading because of how React-leaflet works
- Able to select city by country and/or region through modal
    - üî© Basic implementation - continuing to improve
